# csgost
csgost (short for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive StatTracker and prounced "cs ghost") is a free, open-source statistics tracking utility built using the MEAN stack. A custom HLTV API was built for this project and is freely available for use. It checks for matches posted on HLTV's 'Stats -> Matches' page and updates an internal database every five minutes.

POST requests sent to /api/matches with maps/teams_or/teams_and/days will have a JSON response returned. If you have any questions about this project, please feel free to email me at ryan.fox@oit.edu.

In addition, if you would like to use this API, you are absolutely welcome to! Please let me know, though, as I'd love to see what it gets used for. :)
